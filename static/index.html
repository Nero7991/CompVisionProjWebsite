Please see <a href="http://vision.cs.utexas.edu/projects/adapted_attributes/">this</a> for an example of how to lay out the various details of your project. You may need to provide more details than this, because you will not be submitting an associated paper to accompany the webpage. So the page should be self-contained.

<!-- Goal -->
<h3>Abstract</h3>

Facial features vary greatly from one individual to another, and even for a single individual, there is a large amount of variation due to 3D pose, size, position, viewing angle, and illumination conditions. This project is to forecast the locations of key points on facial pictures. Detecting key points on face images are building blocks of several applications:<br><br>
1.	Face filters, which overlay facial photographs with funny objects, have become commonplace like snapchat.<br>
2.	Analysing facial expressions play an important role in developing real-time applications for biometrics, detecting drowsiness and reading a person's emotions.<br>
3.	Unlocking mobile phones, determine age of the person<br>
4.	Detecting dysmorphic facial signs for medical diagnosis<br>

<!-- Introduction -->
<h3>Introduction</h3>
One of the most distinguishing features of humans is their face. Through evolution, it has become the primary method of identifying other people and expressing feelings and emotions to others. Identifying and classifying faces thus is a crucial task in many computer vision applications. Basic identification of faces allows one to track the number of people in an image. Identifying key facial features can be potentially used to identify facial expressions, which can be further extrapolated to recognising emotions and identifying emotions of a person in an image opens a lot of doors to perform further processing such as in criminal situations where it is crucial to know what state of mind someone is in. 
<!-- <br>  Motivation behind the problem you are solving, what applications it has, any brief background on the particular domain you are working in (if not regular RBG photographs), etc. If you are using a new way to solve an existing problem, briefly mention and describe the existing approaches and tell us how your approach is new. -->

<br><br>
<!-- Approach -->
<h3>Approach</h3>
Describe very clearly and systematically your approach to solve the problem. Tell us exactly what existing implementations you used to build your system. Tell us what obstacles you faced and how you addressed them. Justify any design choices or judgment calls you made in your approach.

<br><br>
<!-- Results -->
<h3>Experiments and results</h3>
Provide details about the experimental set up (number of images/videos, number of datasets you experimented with, train/test split if you used machine learning algorithms, etc.). Describe the evaluation metrics you used to evaluate how well your approach is working. Include clear figures and tables, as well as illustrative qualitative examples if appropriate. Be sure to include obvious baselines to see if your approach is doing better than a naive approach (e.g. for classification accuracy, how well would a classifier do that made random decisions?). Also discuss any parameters of your algorithms, and tell us how you set the values of those parameters. You can also show us how the performance varies as you change those parameter values. Be sure to discuss any trends you see in your results, and explain why these trends make sense. Are the results as expected? Why?
